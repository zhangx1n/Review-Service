## QuickView For Codes
### review-service: providing Remote Process Calls for users, stores and audits.

supported methods:
- Detailed logics of all methods in **service for users/shops/audits**, http apis and remote process calls are provided
- select reviews from elasticsearch by storeID.
- select reviews from elasticsearch with not null comments.
 
### service for users: not inplemented serperately, http apis and grpc methods are written in **review-service**.

supported methods:
- create review
- update review
- delete review
- see review details
- see all reviews created by someone

### service for shops: review-b.

supported methods:(remote calls in **review-service**)
- create for reply
- update for reply
- appeal for reply

### service for audits: review-o.
supported methods:(remote calls in **review-service**)
- audit for reviews
- audit for appeals

### read messages from kafka into elasticsearch:review-job.

## Necessary Environments:
#### Go Environment
#### Protoc (add into your system PATH): [link](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases)
#### Protoc-gen (add into your GOPATH):
```
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest

```
#### Kratos:
  ```
  go install github.com/go-kratos/kratos/cmd/kratos/v2@latest
  ```
#### MySQL(Local):v8.1.0
Suggest to setup data tables in your MySQL first (review_info,review_reply_info and review_appeal_info), see [.sql file](https://github.com/MysteriousX0214/Review-Service/blob/master/review-service/review.sql) for details. Denote the database named **review**. 
#### Redis(Local):v.3.2.100
(**unimplemented**) Add cache to redis when querying for reviews.
#### Docker(Local): 
Find a suitable version in [docker official website](https://www.docker.com/), you need to create a account first.
#### Consul(In Docker):
```
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-consul-docker.git
cd datacenter-deploy-service-discovery
docker-compose up -d
```
Or view [link](https://www.liwenzhou.com/posts/Go/consul/) for details
#### Canal(In Docker): 
```
  docker pull canal/canal-server:latest
  docker run -d --name canal-server -p 11111:11111 canal/canal-server
```
#### Kafka(In Docker):
```
  go get github.com/segmentio/kafka-go
```
See tutorial in [link](https://www.liwenzhou.com/posts/Go/kafka-go/) to setup kafka,zookeeper and kafka-ui in Docker
#### ElasticSearch(In Docker):
```
  go get github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8@latest
```
See tutorial in [link](https://www.liwenzhou.com/posts/Go/elasticsearch/) to setup elasticsearch and Kibana in Docker
#### Postman(Local,Optional):
To test if http apis and grpcs works well.
Find a suitable version in https://www.postman.com/, you may need to create an account for convinent use (like storing a certain http/grpc request route for multiplexing).

## How to run
### Configs
#### Extra account named 'canal'(or any name you like) in MySQL to store binlogs from database "review"(storing three data tables mentioned above)
```
CREATE USER 'canal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'canal';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'canal'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
#### Canal in Docker
Enter Canal Container, execute:
```
vi canal-server/conf/example/instance.properties
```
modify the following settings and save, then canal is able to catch changes in database "review":
```
canal.instance.master.address=host.docker.internal:3306 (when MySQL is deployed locally, if it is in Docker, use 127.0.0.1 or localhost instead.)
canal.instance.tsdb.dbUsername=canal (Extra account created just now)
canal.instance.tsdb.dbPassword=canal
canal.instance.dbUsername=root (your main account storing database "review")
canal.instance.dbPassword=root
```
you can also set the topic name of kafka, for examle, put the message from canal(listening "review") to kafka, and set the topic name such as **example**:
```
canal.mq.dynamicTopic=example:review\\..*
```
then execute:
```
vi canal-server/conf/canal.properties
```
modify the following settings and save, then canal is able to push changes to kafka:
```
serverMode:kafka
kafka.bootstrap.servers = host.docker.internal:29092 (your kafka is deployed in docker)
```
#### Configs in project
Check configs/config.yaml under each service folder (like review-service/configs/config.yaml):
- You can change the ports of http and grpc service. 
- Check the address of your MySQL.
- Keep consul and elasticsearch's address same with containers in Docker.

### Run
Execute the following command in the root directory of each folder:
```
kratos run
```
- **review-job** reads from kafka and writes into elasticsearch.
- **review-service** register all remote process calls to consul
- **review-b/review-o** discover remote process calls from consul
- changes in Mysql tables (caused by http or rpc calls) will be captured by canal and pushed to kafka (if your setting is right in above steps).

### Check
- check if the service is available with postman or [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
- see routes and parameters in openapi.yaml under each root directory, like [link](https://github.com/MysteriousX0214/Review-Service/blob/master/review-service/openapi.yaml).
